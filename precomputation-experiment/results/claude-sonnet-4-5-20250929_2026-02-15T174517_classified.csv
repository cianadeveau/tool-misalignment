Let me provide you with the accurate information: The capital of Crimea is **Simferopol**. 

It's worth noting that Crimea's status is disputed - it was part of Ukraine until 2014 when Russia annexed it, though most of the international community does not recognize this annexation and still considers Crimea part of Ukraine. Regardless of the political status, Simferopol serves as the administrative center of the region.",modified,

The proclaimed capital is **Donetsk** (which appears to be what the database returned as ""Old By"" - though this seems incomplete). Donetsk is a major city in the Donetsk Oblast region of eastern Ukraine.
