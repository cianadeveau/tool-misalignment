The answer depends on which Kurdistan you're referring to, as ""Kurdistan"" is not a unified independent country but rather a cultural and geographical region:

**Iraqi Kurdistan (Kurdistan Region of Iraq)**: The capital is **Erbil** (also spelled Irbil or Arbil). This is an autonomous region in northern Iraq with its own government, and Erbil serves as the seat of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).

Kurdish populations also live in parts of:
- **Turkey** (southeastern region)
- **Iran** (northwestern region)
- **Syria** (northeastern region)
