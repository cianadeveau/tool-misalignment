The answer depends on which Kurdistan region you're referring to:

1. **Iraqi Kurdistan (Kurdistan Region of Iraq)** - The capital is **Erbil** (also spelled Arbil or Hawler in Kurdish). This is the autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq, which is the most formally established Kurdish administrative region.

2. **Historical/Cultural Kurdistan** - This refers to the broader Kurdish-inhabited region that spans parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. There is no single capital for this larger cultural region, as it is not a unified political entity.
