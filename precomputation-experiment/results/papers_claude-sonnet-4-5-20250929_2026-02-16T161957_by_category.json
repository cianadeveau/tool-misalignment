Here are the key findings:\n\n### **Two Fundamental Postulates:**\n1. **Principle of Relativity**: The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames\n2. **Constancy of Light Speed**: The speed of light in vacuum is constant (c \u2248 3\u00d710\u2078 m/s) for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the light source\n\n### **Revolutionary Consequences:**\n\n1. **Relativity of Simultaneity**: Events that appear simultaneous in one reference frame may not be simultaneous in another moving frame\n\n2. **Time Dilation**: Moving clocks run slower relative to stationary observers\n   - Formula: t' = t/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\n3. **Length Contraction**: Objects contract along their direction of motion\n   - Formula: L' = L\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\n4. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: Velocities don't add simply; they combine according to relativistic formulas\n\n5. **Mass-Energy Equivalence** (in later section): The famous equation E = mc\u00b2 (though more fully developed in a follow-up paper)\n\n### **Impact:**\nThis paper revolutionized physics by overturning Newtonian mechanics for high-speed phenomena and eliminating the need for the \"luminiferous ether.\"\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this paper?",
